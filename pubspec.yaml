description: The Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK provides the same user experience as the Jitsi Meet app, in form of a Flutter plugin so that you can embed and customize Jitsi Meet in your own Flutter app. Android and iOS are supported. The plugin serves as a wrapper for the iOS and Android SDKs, on top of which a Flutter API was created with functionality similar to those found in native APIs.
